Known Issues,
<ul>
  <li>NVDIA Discrete Graphic, not working. [disabled]</li>
  <li>Combojack Audio, external microphone not working. [internal only]</li>
  <li>Can't wake from Sleep on Battery.</li>
  <li>OEM Wifi Card doesnt work. This configuration is using BCM43xx compatible kexts (AirportBrcmFixup.kext, 
    BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext, BrcmFirmwareData.kext, BrcmPatchRAM3.kext)
    Wifi card with no Bluetooth. So, you need to adjust Kexts folder and config.plist based on your wifi card.

  <li>If your battery is dead, SMCBatteryManager.kext will cause Kernel Panic. 
    To fix this, replace the battery or Remove SMCBatteryManager.kext from kext and config.plist.
